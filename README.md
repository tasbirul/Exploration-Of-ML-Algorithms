In this repository, I'd tried to explore & experiment the most common and important Machine Learning algorithms that are most popular in Data Science community (i.e SVM, Random Forest etc) with real-time examples. I'd also included how the algorithm works under the hood & experimented different algorithm for the same problem to figure out which algorithm is perfect for a specific type  of data.
